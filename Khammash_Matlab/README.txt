README

The file main.m contains instructions for running simulations of open-loop (Figure 5B) and closed-loop co-culture experiments (Figure 6C-D). For closed-loop co-culture experiments, there is further the option to specify a single setpoint or an array of setpoints to be changed a specific times during the experiment (Figure 6E). 

The file optimize_gains.m contains the code that runs the optimization pipeline to determine the best PID gains for a closed-loop co-culture experiment, described in Figure 6B of the main text
